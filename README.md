### Core Technologies:
- **Frontend Framework**: **Next.js 15 (App Router)** using client-side React 19 paradigms.
- **Styling Engine**: **Tailwind CSS v4** for clean UI design, utilizing CSS variables.
- **Database Backend**: **PostgreSQL** with raw SQL query pipelines via the node-postgres (`pg`) client connection pool.
- **Security & Session Auth**: Password hashing via `bcryptjs` and session authorization utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in secure HTTP-only cookies.
- **Micro-interactions**: `react-hot-toast` for real-time validation and actions feedback, and `react-icons` (Feather/Io5/Fa/Md packs) for standard menu triggers.

```

### 3. Database Initialization
Verify that PostgreSQL is running, then populate database tables and relations by executing the schema and seed scripts:
```bash
# Initialize schema tables, indexes and triggers
psql -U your_postgres_user -d school_db -f schema.psql

# Populate seed directories
node scripts/setup-db-tables.js
node scripts/setup-clubs.js
node scripts/setup-results.js
```

### 4. Run Server
Run the local dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
